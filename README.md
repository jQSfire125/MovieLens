# MovieLens

This is the first of two projects that are required for the final course in the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate.

The objective is to use the MovieLens dataset to create a movie recommendation system. We will use the 10 million recommendations version of the dataset (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/) to make the computation a little easier.
